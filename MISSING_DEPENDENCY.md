# Missing Dependency: SDWebImageSwiftUI

The project is currently missing the SDWebImageSwiftUI package, which is needed for the WebImage component used in the app. You need to add this package to the project:

1. In Xcode, go to `File > Add Packages...`
2. Enter the URL: `https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageSwiftUI.git`
3. Select "Up to Next Major Version" (0.9.0 < 1.0.0)
4. Click "Add Package"
5. Make sure the "Card Valuw Scanner" target is selected
6. Click "Add Package" to finish

## Why This Package is Needed

The project currently has SDWebImage added, but we're using the WebImage component which is part of the SDWebImageSwiftUI package. This package provides SwiftUI integration for the SDWebImage library.

## Alternative Solution

If you prefer not to add another dependency, you can modify the code to use AsyncImage (built into SwiftUI) instead of WebImage. However, AsyncImage doesn't have all the features of WebImage like activity indicators and transitions.

Example replacement:

```swift
// Instead of:
WebImage(url: imageURL)
    .resizable()
    .placeholder {
        Rectangle().foregroundColor(.gray.opacity(0.2))
    }
    .indicator(.activity)
    .transition(.fade(duration: 0.5))
    .scaledToFit()

// Use:
AsyncImage(url: imageURL) { phase in
    if let image = phase.image {
        image
            .resizable()
            .scaledToFit()
    } else if phase.error != nil {
        Rectangle().foregroundColor(.gray.opacity(0.2))
            .overlay(
                Image(systemName: "exclamationmark.triangle")
                    .foregroundColor(.red)
            )
    } else {
        Rectangle().foregroundColor(.gray.opacity(0.2))
            .overlay(
                ProgressView()
            )
    }
}
```
