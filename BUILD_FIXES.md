# Build Fixes for Pokemon TCG Scanner App

## Issues Fixed

1. **WebImage Component Not Found**
   - The project was using `WebImage` from `SDWebImageSwiftUI` but only had `SDWebImage` as a dependency.

## Solutions Implemented

### Option 1: Replace WebImage with AsyncImage (Implemented)
- Replaced all `WebImage` components with SwiftUI's built-in `AsyncImage` component
- Modified files:
  - `CardDetailView.swift`
  - `CollectionView.swift`
  - `ScannerView.swift`
- This approach eliminates the need for the additional `SDWebImageSwiftUI` dependency
- AsyncImage provides similar functionality but with a slightly different API

### Option 2: Add SDWebImageSwiftUI Package (Alternative)
If you prefer to use WebImage instead of AsyncImage, you can add the SDWebImageSwiftUI package:

1. In Xcode, go to `File > Add Packages...`
2. Enter the URL: `https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageSwiftUI.git`
3. Select "Up to Next Major Version" (0.9.0 < 1.0.0)
4. Click "Add Package"
5. Make sure the "Card Valuw Scanner" target is selected
6. Click "Add Package" to finish

## Other Fixes

- Created a new `Info.plist` file with necessary permissions and configurations:
  - Camera usage description
  - Photo library usage description
  - App Transport Security settings
  - Pokemon TCG API key placeholder

## Benefits of the Current Solution

1. **Reduced Dependencies**: Using AsyncImage reduces the number of external dependencies
2. **Native SwiftUI**: AsyncImage is a native SwiftUI component
3. **Simpler Maintenance**: Fewer dependencies mean simpler project maintenance
4. **Smaller App Size**: No additional libraries needed for image loading

## Comparison: AsyncImage vs WebImage

| Feature | AsyncImage | WebImage |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Native SwiftUI | ✅ | ❌ |
| Activity Indicator | ✅ (Customizable) | ✅ (Built-in) |
| Image Transitions | ❌ | ✅ |
| Advanced Caching | ❌ | ✅ |
| Memory Usage | Lower | Higher |
| Dependency Required | None | SDWebImageSwiftUI |

Choose the approach that best fits your project's needs. The current implementation uses AsyncImage for simplicity and reduced dependencies.
